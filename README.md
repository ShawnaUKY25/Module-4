# Module-4
*A brief introduction to what a LAMP stack is and why it is commonly used.*

A LAMP stack is a popular open-source software bundle used to build and run websites and web applications. It consists of Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database), and PHP (programming language). Libraries and businesses commonly use the LAMP stack because it is free, flexible, and reliable, making it ideal for hosting digital repositories, managing content, and running applications like integrated library systems (ILS) and content management systems.

This is how the index.htmloriginal file looks live on the web.


*Any challenges you encountered and how you revolved them.*

Saving the new text file in nano was a challenge, because I for got the command O, then command exit. It took me a few times to realize I could type in the white bar, and then I found myself with gorilla fingers, each time I went to safe the file. I decided to choose index.htmloriginal as my go to file.
